<h1>Travel Meals Around The World</h1>
<p>Here is my food diary blog to show what I eat when traveling around the world. The prices for all the meals have been converted to pounds for easier understanding, and ranked for taste for anyone who wants to try the same dishes. 
    The first food diary entry is for Japan to showcase the food I ate and the restaurants which I ate in. Enjoy!!
